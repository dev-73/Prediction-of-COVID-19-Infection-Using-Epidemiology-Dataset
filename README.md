In this paper we are predicting  and forecasting the COVID-19 outbreak in World  on machine learning approach, the aim of the  project is to provide data analysis of covid-19 (a  pandemic started in December 2019) using  different kind of ML models such as SVM,  polynomial regression and Prophet. Using those  three models we predicting conform, death and  recover cases for the World and we take one  country which is India. Through plotting of data,  various cases have been studied like most affected  countries due to this pandemic as well as most  affected state in India. In this paper we are using  Time series dataset provided by Johns Hopkins  University. The model is predicting the number of  confirmed, recover and death cases based on data  available from 22nd January, 2020 till up to today.  In this project, the predictions on various cases  have been done and finally, the accuracy of the  algorithm has been determined. Comparison  graphs has also been plotted to analyses how much  World and INDIA is getting affected/recover day  by day.
